# CNN-Practice-with-FashionMNIST-and-CIFAR10

This is my practice implementation of Convolutional Neural Netwroks on Fashion MNIST & CIFAR10 Dataset. All multi-class classifications are implemented with both TensorFlow & PyTorch.

For the case of multi class classification on CIFAR10 dataset, it is implemented not only without data augmentation but also improved version with large CNN and data augmentation in order to check and realize how the model was improved.

In all notebooks, the results of the models are evaluted by confusion matrix and it is evaluted the prediction results as the `true-classified examples` and also `misclassified example`.

The following are the Notebook of all implementations:
