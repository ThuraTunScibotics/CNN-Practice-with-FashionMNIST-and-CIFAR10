# CNN-Practice-with-FashionMNIST-and-CIFAR10

This is my practice implementation of Convolutional Neural Netwroks on Fashion MNIST & CIFAR10 Dataset. All are implemented with both TensorFlow & PyTorch.
For the case of multi class classification on CIFAR10 dataset, it is implemented not only without data augmentation but also improved version with large CNN and data augmentation in order to check and realize how the model was improved.
In all notebooks, the results of the models are evaluted by confusion matrix and it is evaluted the prediction results not only in the `true-classified examples` but also in `misclassified example`.
